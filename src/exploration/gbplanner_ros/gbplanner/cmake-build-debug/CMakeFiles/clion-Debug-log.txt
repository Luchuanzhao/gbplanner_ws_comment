CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcatkin_simple.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "catkin_simple", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "catkin_simple"
  with any of the following names:

    catkin_simpleConfig.cmake
    catkin_simple-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "catkin_simple" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "catkin_simple_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "catkin_simple" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
